==== Xmlerr ====

  XML parsing with error for OCaml.

  This thing is an experimental/toy/alpha thing
  written in OCaml in one afternoon, which attempts
  to parse XML with errors, also known as HTML.

  And it does so in a very basic way, the type
  returned will not represent a valid XML document
  except if the original document is valid XML.
  And even then, xmlerr is alpha so you should
  probably not expect too much from it.
